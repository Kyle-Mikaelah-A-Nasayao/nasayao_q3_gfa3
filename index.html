        <p>Three of the most popular social media platforms/sites are Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram.</p>
        <p>A random sample of 60 high school students were asked which site they use the most and how much time they usually take on it every day. The results are displayed below:</p>
        <div class="data data1">
            <p>Facebook</p><hr>
            <span id="fbNum"></span>

            <span id="ytNum"></span>

            <p>Instagram</p><hr>
            <span id="igNum"></span>
        </div>
        <p>Participants who do not use any of the sites often: <span id="noUse"></span></p>
        <p>The platform with the most users from the sample is: <span id="biggestNum"></span></p>
